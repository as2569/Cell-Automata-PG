The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of cell automata to generate terrain maps.

Define x and y grid size maximum by modifiying x_max and y_max variables (line 343 and 344).

num_tests on line 343 is the number of runs of the generator.

windowsSize on line 352

Passes:
Seed 
Cluster
Coast
Hill
Mountain

There is a civilization simulation that is currently commented out for simplicity's sake.
